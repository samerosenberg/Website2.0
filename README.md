# My Website 2.0

Welcome to my portfolio website's repository! This is my newest attempt at creating a website portfolio to highlight who I am!

Check out the website at [samrosenberg.io](https://samrosenberg.io/)!

This was all coded in Typescript/CSS and built using the [React Framework](https://reactjs.org/).

Thanks to [tschaub](https://github.com/tschaub) for his [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) Node package that handles deploying the site using Github Pages. If you would like to try this for yourself also check out [gitname's](https://github.com/gitname) tutorial at [react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).
