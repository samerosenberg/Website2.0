            <br></br>
            <p>
                I graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelors Degree in computer
                science and a minor in statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was able to take a multitude of classes ranging from the
                fields of mathematics, history, psychology, philosophy and most
                importantly computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am very thankful for my time and the wonderful friends I made
                along the way while attending Pitt.
            </p>
            <br></br>

                <strong>Hail to Pitt!</strong>
